     NOTE:
     For the various if and else if statments, I used the call 
     'pid = fork() < 0' or 'pid = fork() == 0' because I was searching on how
     to call the fork in the if statement. As I searched online I saw many 
     different wants to call the fork in the if statements. I decided to use
     'pid = fork()' because it made sense in my head as I was designing and
     coding this program.

     Below is the code where the program forks and creates the children 
     from the parent processes. There will be 2 pipes created (1st between great 
     grandchild and grandchild, 2nd between grandchild and child) and from there,
     the program is designed so that it will have the path where the great 
     grandchild can only write to the pipe, the grandchild can read from the 1st
     pipe and write to the 2nd pipe and then the child can only read from the
     2nd pipe.
